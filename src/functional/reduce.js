/*

 Implement Array#reduce using recursion.

 For simplicity, your implementation of reduce
 **need not replicate the behaviour of a reduce missing an initial value**.
 You may assume the initial value will always be supplied.

 Arguments

 * list: An list (one-dimensional listay) to reduce over
 * fn:   Function to use as the reduction step.
         Like regular Array#reduce, this function must be passed:
         * previousValue
         * currentValue
         * index
         * list we're iterating over.
 * initial: Initial value of the reduction.
         Unlike Array#reduce, this value is required (and you may assume it will always be supplied).

 Conditions

 * Do not use any for/while loops.
 * Do not use any Array methods like map or reduce.
